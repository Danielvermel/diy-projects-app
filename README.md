## Description

This is a small prototype project developed in my free time where you can post different DIY projects you made. For this project I used the MERN stack: 
- MongoDB;
- Express.js;
- React.js;
- Node.js

## Setup
1. Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/);
3. Download the project by using `git clone git@github.com:Danielvermel/diy-projects-app.git` in your terminal;
4. Create a MongoDB Atlas account [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas);
5. Go to the Database Access tab and add a new Database user;
6. In main menu and click `Connect` > `Connect your Application` and copy the connection string;
7. In your project go to `server/.env` and followed by `CONNECTION_URL =` paste your connection string; 
8. Don't forget to change the `<password>` and `<username>` in that string according to the credencials you previously created;
9. Open two terminals, one with the client folder and another with the server folder; 
10. Run `npm i` to install all dependencies on both terminals;
9. And finally run `npm start` on both terminals;
